abstract: "*Sarcocheilichthys sinensis* (Bleeker), is a small-sized benthopelagic fish with ornamental value. In the present study, the complete mitochondrial genome of *S. sinensis* was sequenced and determined. The complete mitogenome of *S. sinensis* was 16,683 bp in length, consisting of 22 tRNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, and 2 non-coding regions. The overall base composition of the *S. sinensis* mitogenome is 30.50% A, 26.28% T, 26.60% C, and 16.61% G, exhibiting obvious AT bias (56.79%). The phylogenetic analysis showed that *S. sinensis* clustered in genus *Sarcocheilichthys*. Present study provides useful data to population genetics and conservation biology of *Sarcocheilichthys* fishes."
